# TowerOfHanoi

In this first part of the project, I am working with data structures such as Stacks, Queues and Deques. Stacks are containers of objects that are pushed (inserted) and popped (removed) according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) rule. Queues are containers of objects that are pushed (inserted) and popped (removed) according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) rule. Finally, Deques are known as a double-ended queue, are an order of collection of items very similar to the queue. In addition, you can have elements be pushed (inserted) and popped (removed) according to the front and to a rear end. 

In the first part of the project, you will find the implementation of three classes:
1.	Stack class
2.	Qu (Queue) class
3.	Deque class
	
In the second part of the project (Part-2: Applications) there are displayed 3 different applications by implementing the data structures mention above.

A)	Tower of Hanoi

B)	Cars lined up at a car wash

C)	Using deque for a train functionality
